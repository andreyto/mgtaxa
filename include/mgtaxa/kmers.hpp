/** State machine for k-mers along with a corresponding payload object
 * implemented in  KmerStates and  KmerCounter classes respectively. 
 * The current implementation is optimized for the following use case:
 * <ol>
 * <li> relatively short k-mers (k < 10)</li>
 * <li> @anchor AnchShortSeqInp k-mer counts will be computed for many short chunks of sequence, which assumes
 * the following set of operations</li>
 * <ul> <li>reset counts</li> <li>stream through sequence chunk</li> <li>report the counts</li> 
 * <li>repeat</li></ul>
 * Typical length of sequence chunk (~1000 nuc) is less than the number of
 * possible k-mers (~16,000 for k = 7).
 * <li> k-mer counts will be extracted only for non-redundant subset of 
 * reverse complement k-mers (~8,000 for k = 7)</li>
 * </ol>
 * In view of @ref AnchShortSeqInp "2", we will keep the "payload" for each state node separately,
 * referenced by the pointer to an instance of KmerStateData class. The payload object will 
 * contain the back reference
 * to its state and the count, and the payloads can be allocated as needed, from a pre-allocated
 * array. The size of payload array is bound by the max chunk length x 2 (direct plus reverse-complement
 * sequence lengths), or the total number of possible k-mers for a given k, whichever is less.
 * Therefore, we pre-allocate storage for the payload array of with the total number of possible k-mers.
 * 
 * The current implementation uses dense k-mer state machine (all possible k-mers are
 * preallocated and states are initialized) with sparse payload: all states have initially 
 * their payloads set to NULL. As we stream through the input sequence, we move from the current
 * state to the next one. At each step, we take the first of the reverse complement pair of states,
 * and check if its payload is NULL. If it is, we allocate the new payload object. Then, we 
 * increment the count in the payload object.
 *
 * Any implementation of KmerStates must guarantee this:
 * All degenerate states point to the very first (zero) state as their reverse-complement state.
 * That allows KmerCounter to link zero state to a single dummy KmerStateData object.
 * Thus, reverse-complement link is not symmetric for degenerate states.
 *
 * When counts are to be extracted, we have to loop only through the payload objects for those k-mers 
 * that were actually seen and represent the non-redundant subset of all reverse-complement pairs.  
 * 
 * After construction, this implementation guarantees the following complexity during
 * the sequence processing: O(1) on k-mer length; O(min(L,N)) where L is the actual sequence chunk
 * length and N is the number of possible k-mers + O(min(L,N)*log(min(L,N))) if results are sorted
 * by k-mer ID for extraction.*/
